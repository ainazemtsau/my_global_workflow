# converge-g-9c41 — formed question set (RETROFIT, FORM pass)

> **Status: FORM pass only (checkpoint).** This document FORMS the converge question-set for node

> this is a parallel retrofit on the same node.

## Header — triage & import

```
triage: HEAVY — converge ON — because model? YES (the chunked-delta gas stream is model-bearing:
        a wrong stub is fatal and it defines the networked product) AND contract? YES (consumes/
        produces across 4 siblings g-d3a8/g-7e15/g-5b07/g-e6f2 + DA/PGG generators) AND decomposes
        into subsystems (field / stream / render-seam / ingestion / scale tier).
mode:   RETROFIT — node g-9c41 is active/in-flight (bet committed s-shape-003); import settled
        decisions born-closed (step 1), frame only what is still open.
imported_from: [history/s-shape-003 (d-arch-001 a–e, R5/R12/R13/R14/R15, vendor=FishNet, cut_list),
                history/s-work-004 (kill-gate "A" dual guarantee + reconstruction/anti-gaming facts),
                history/s-work-003 via NOW.md (t-1 GREEN core/seam contracts)]
knowledge_scan: knowledge/ EMPTY (no canon yet) — imports come from history/ only.
next_movement: heavy + sibling-bearing -> converge-arch for the grid↔gas / gas-type-seam / render-
               seam / ingestion contracts; the mechanism-parameter rows route to PLAN/ADR-0003.
```

**HARDENING NOTE (design-doc fix b, load-bearing).** The imported kill-gate "A" (I6–I11) NAMES the
chunked-delta mechanism and its dual guarantee. Per Resolve 3(c), *closing a mechanism never closes
its parameters*: importing "A" closes the PROPERTIES (bit-exactness, bounded divergence, settle
convergence, both-clamps-engaged) but leaves every internal MAGNITUDE (Q, deadband, the two clamps,
N, K, channel reliability, …) OPEN as → PLAN rows in §WHAT-C. This is exactly the witness fix — without
it a retrofit would swallow the stream and never mint Q/N/K.

## §GLOSSARY — disputed terms (read 2+ ways on disk)

Seeded mechanically from done_when + lens nouns; only terms read 2+ ways qualify (miner pass
wf_cfafde76-73f). TERM-PROPERTY RULE: a §WHAT line cites a term only for a property in its row.

| id | term | meaning-here (load-bearing properties) | competing readings (on-disk) |
|---|---|---|---|
| G:chunk | chunk (chunked-delta / dirty-chunk / chunk-grid) | quantized delta unit streamed host→client; only CHANGED chunks sent; carries a revision + resolution-key; on-wire BYTE size is the first honest measurement; per-tick dirty-COUNT is the environment-independent number | WIRE-UNIT (0.6–6 KB payload, NOW p4) vs SPATIAL CELL-GROUP / storage block (brief §3.5/§3.6 "chunked-хранилище слоёв", "256 чанков") vs CHUNK-GRID profile (NOW "chunk grid, total chunk count") |
| G:topology-change | topology change / revision | fires deterministically on an agreed tick; two rooms merge / breach portals added; carries a topology-revision exposed by debug surfaces; consistency must hold ACROSS it | DESTRUCTION-DRIVEN (TREE goal, root #4) vs SCRIPTED-BREACH-ONLY no destruction system (NOW cut_list, t-2) vs STATIC-GRAPH portals on immutable volumes (brief §3.7) |
| G:consistency | consistency / consistent gas behavior | the owner-signed acceptance oracle; **signed "A"** = BOTH readings at once, in TWO runs | PER-TICK BIT-EXACT lossless (s-work-004 (i)) vs BOUNDED-DIVERGENCE-≤Q + converge-at-settle lossy (s-work-004 (ii)) |
| G:meta-gas | meta-gas / gas / gas type | two-level: meta-gas = behavior archetype (own handler behind extension seam) / gas = pure config; R15 layered params; R5 field-transported | BEHAVIOR-ARCHETYPE+seam (#4, R15) vs FIELD-TRANSPORTED-config R5-refined (AGENT_SUBSTRATE removed — supersedes brief §3.3) vs DESIGN-ROSTER gameplay-job (sibling g-d3a8) |
| G:coarse-tier | coarse simulation tier / band sim / coarse truth | DESIGNED + ARITHMETIC-VALIDATED (not built) to hold ~200×200×40 m, ≥1000 volumes within min-spec budgets; clip rendered FROM band state | SECTOR-BAND GRAPH 2–3 bands (brief §3.1, approach) vs DAY-ONE 1-sector/2-band degrading to scalar-per-volume (cut_list, brief §5) vs ARITHMETIC-PAPER-ONLY for this node (#9) |
| G:min-spec | min-spec profile / class | 8GB-VRAM 60-class GPU + 16GB RAM (NOT the dev 4090); gates perf (#1), render ms-budget (#6), scale budgets (#9) | HARDWARE acceptance floor (#1) vs CHEAP-VALIDATION proxy (3060 / capped) vs UNMEASURED ARITHMETIC anchor pending micro-bench (brief §4/§7) |
| G:agent-drivable | agent-drivable / agent | harness machine-drivable: headless, deterministic seeds, machine-readable telemetry, no sprawl | HARNESS-DRIVER (#5) vs AI-SELF-PLAY actor (g-d3a8 #5) vs VISION/RED-TEAM/BUILD-VALIDATE LLM (g-7e15 #2, model_routing) vs the REMOVED AGENT_SUBSTRATE gas (R5) |
| G:harness | validation harness / harness scene | headless, deterministic seeds, machine-readable telemetry, NO scene sprawl; hosts the hash check; supports product-visuals for the clip | NET-CONSISTENCY HASH-RIG (brief §5, t-1) vs FIXED PRODUCT-SCENE SET (#5) vs CLIP/RENDER STAGE (#8, g-7e15 #1/#5) |
| G:destruction | destruction / spatial change / destruction-driven | node needs ≥1 destruction-DRIVEN topology change; the bet delivers a scripted breach (no destruction system) | DESTRUCTION SYSTEM gameplay-depth (charter lens 2, #3, pre-mortem #3) vs SCRIPTED-BREACH stand-in (cut_list) vs SPATIAL-CHANGE root-level OR (root #4) |
| G:replication | replication model | LOCKED: host single-writer field + chunked-delta; entity ghosts only for players/objects; GPU never authoritative | SINGLE-WRITER chunked-delta FIELD (t-2) vs LOCKSTEP inputs-only (t-1, ADR-0002) vs ENTITY GHOSTS for non-gas — THREE coexisting planes, must not conflate |
| G:render-slice | render proof slice / stylization | timeboxed ≤2wk; locks the stylization hypothesis (default quantized volumetrics) + render-pipeline decision behind a SEAM; ms-budget on min-spec; clip from band state, no T2 | SEAM-LOCK decision artifact (#6) vs CLIP-PRODUCING render (brief §5/§8) vs DOWNSTREAM g-7e15 visual-identity pipeline (g-7e15 #4 — g-9c41 only locks the seam) |
| G:player-count | player count / player-hosted / 1-player / co-op | clean 1-player must run; count = first-class CONFIG input, no bots; fantasy range 2–4 co-op-first | CONFIG-INPUT parametric (#7, g-d3a8) vs FIXED 3-PEER net-spike topology (t-2: 1 host + 2 clients) vs PLAYER-HOSTED listen topology (R12) |
| G:ingestion | procedural generators / ingestion adapter (DA / PGG) | REPLACEABLE adapter is the WHAT (seam survives); generator behind it is HOW; DA day-one minimum, PGG parked | NAIVE day-one adapter ~100–300 objects vs FULL occupancy+1000-object gate (bet-2) vs REPLACEABLE-SEAM proven on DA alone (PGG behind same seam) |
| G:settle | settle / quiescence point | the tick at which lossy client MUST equal host bit-exact; defines C8's predicate N + the non-vacuous post-breach settle assertion | NETWORK quiescence (dirty-chunks==0 for N ticks) vs PHYSICAL re-equilibration after breach (brief §3.1/§3.5 merged rooms relax) vs HASH-equality convergence — conflated in the "settle/keyframe" kill-gate wording; resolve must also sign that post-breach physical re-equilibration is GUARANTEED to produce a network-quiescence settle (else C8's assertion can fail to fire) |
| G:temperature | температура / energy | **RESOLVED 2026-06-14 (s-converge-002):** a thin DYNAMIC LAYER in the core — own data structure + minimal optimized sim, sibling of gas, on the grid event/revision bus (subscribes to events, can feed/read reactions); in core to PROVE layer-extensibility + cross-system interaction, NOT for gameplay/aesthetics | STATIC field for stratification/R4 contract (brief §3.8) vs THIN DYNAMIC LAYER for architecture proof (owner R2/R3) vs NONE — resolved = thin dynamic layer (see §RESOLVED-1) |

`canon_proposed (glossary ids -> review/pulse promote to knowledge/)`: G:chunk, G:consistency,
G:replication, G:coarse-tier, G:topology-change (the net-consistency vocabulary t-3 + future net work
will read). converge proposes; review/pulse promote (authorship rule).

## §WHAT — flat question set (one question / line)

Tags: `answered` (born-closed import, cited source) · `open→PLAN` (HOW magnitude/format — ADR-0003) ·
`open→G7` (owner-owned design/acceptance fact — a later resolve pass signs) · `open→arch`
(cross-node contract — converge-arch). A row carrying both a property and a magnitude SPLITS (the
property half may be `answered`, the magnitude half `open→PLAN`). No row is signed in this FORM pass.

### §WHAT/IMPORTS — born-closed (answered, decided before this node converged)

| id | the decided WHAT | tag | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Replication LOCKED: host = single authoritative writer of the gas field; clients RECONSTRUCT without running the sim; entity ghosts only for players/objects; GPU never authoritative for networked state. *(NAMES the mechanism → params decompose in §WHAT-C.)* | answered | history/s-shape-003 (node #2) + history/s-work-004 (THE PIVOT) |
| I2 | The gas field rides OUR OWN custom chunked-delta channel ALONGSIDE FishNet — a SECOND plane, never retrofitted into `ITickInputBus` (input-only). | answered | history/s-shape-003 (R14) + NOW boundaries |
| I3 | Network vendor = FishNet; model locked, vendor swappable; no P6 / vendor re-open in this leg. | answered | history/s-shape-003 |
| I4 | Engine-free pure-C# integer-only authoritative core (R13); determinism contract (no float/double, `unchecked`, seeded RNG, pinned little-endian hash order, stable input order); 8 core tests + golden vector green. | answered | history/s-shape-003 (R13) + s-work-003 via NOW |
| I5 | 3-mode composition root (pure-local / local host-loop / networked) chosen at the DI root (`CreateNetworked(seed,localPeerId,injectedBus)`); player count = first-class config; no bots/AI companions. | answered | history/s-shape-003 (R13/R14) + node #7 |
| I6 | Kill-gate "A" = the DUAL guarantee defines "consistency holds" (resolves p2-vs-p3 as TWO runs, not one). *(NAMES the mechanism → params decompose.)* | answered | history/s-work-004 |
| I7 | Lossless (i): deadband OFF → per-tick host-vs-each-client reconstructed-field-cell hash BIT-EXACT over the whole run incl. the breach (the correctness oracle). | answered | history/s-work-004 + NOW p2 |
| I8 | Lossy (ii): deadband + both clamps ON → divergence BOUNDED every tick + convergence to bit-exact at settle/keyframe. *(PROPERTY closed; magnitudes Q/N/K/deadband/clamps stay open in §WHAT-C.)* | answered | history/s-work-004 + NOW p3 |
| I9 | Hash domain = reconstructed FIELD CELLS only (Fnv1a64 pinned LE, reused from t-1) — NOT whole `SimState.Hash()` (folds Delta+RNG the non-simulating client lacks); breach-affected cells inside the domain. | answered | history/s-work-004 + NOW p2 |
| I10 | Anti-gaming: lossless (p2) and lossy (p3) MUST share the SAME reconstruction code path. | answered | NOW p3 |
| I11 | All THREE flow controls (deadband + per-client clamp + aggregate host clamp) must exist and be engaged together (a silently-disabled clamp = FAIL). *(PROPERTY; the three magnitudes stay open.)* | answered | NOW p3 + history/s-work-004 |
| I12 | R5-refined: special/anomalous gases are FIELD-TRANSPORTED by the same simulation, NOT agents/enemies/self-directed; distinguished by params+visual+effects; AGENT_SUBSTRATE + velocity-intent REMOVED from the concept. | answered | history/s-shape-003 (R5) |
| I13 | R15: layered gas params — shared parent params for ALL gases (density, per-cell packing, spread speed) + per-meta-gas own params + per-meta-gas visual procedurally generated from params; specific gas = pure config. | answered | history/s-shape-003 (R15) |
| I14 | R12: one player hosts; no dedicated server, ever (decided, not researched). | answered | history/s-shape-003 (R12) |
| I15 | d-arch-001(a): the far/coarse tier is always-on, NEVER frozen; 1 Hz cold-rung counts as never-frozen. *(10/5/1 Hz ladder magnitude → PLAN, bet-2.)* | answered | history/s-shape-003 |
| I16 | d-arch-001(b): far-consequence latency bound = sim ≤100 ms / perceived 100–300 ms. | answered | history/s-shape-003 |
| I17 | d-arch-001(c): stratification = 2–3 bands + a derived interface height (N bands = config). *(band-count magnitude → PLAN.)* | answered | history/s-shape-003 |
| I18 | d-arch-001(d): SUPERSEDED by the R5 reframe — scalar source/sink driver day-one; velocity/agent removed (not merely deferred). | answered | history/s-shape-003 |
| I19 | d-arch-001(e): the perception-ceiling question is answered inside the render slice (criterion 6). | answered | history/s-shape-003 |
| I20 | Late-join / join-baseline is OUT of t-2 scope: all 3 peers present from tick 0; only the revision/keyframe baseline FORM is declared; mid-run join → bet-2. | answered | NOW boundaries |
| I21 | Node-vs-bet scope (cut_list): physical destruction → scripted-breach event only (no destruction system); T2 / sector-subdivision / freq-ladder / DA occupancy+1000-object gate → bet-2; PGG / 2nd generator → parked; tick rate = 10 Hz day-one. ⚠ **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED 2026-06-14 (s-converge-002):** "scripted-breach only" → RESOLVED-2 (real CONTROLLED breach); cut_list "day-one static temperature field" → RESOLVED-1 (thin DYNAMIC temperature layer). Other cuts (T2/sector/freq-ladder/DA-gate/PGG/10Hz) STAND. | answered (partial supersede) | history/s-shape-003 (cut_list) + history/s-converge-002 |
| I22 | Process: the G0 ledger is frozen BEFORE build, default-FAIL (every entry opened failing, flipped only on opened evidence), builder never edits ledger/spec/criteria/config. | answered | NOW (leg_opens_with + Process) |
| I23 | Replication criterion-2 sub-clause: rollback/lockstep is bounded to AT MOST one 1–2-week timeboxed spike; inputs ride lockstep (ADR-0002), the field never as inputs; the P6 spike (FishNet↔NGO, last-resort rollback) is the only escape, not an extend. | answered | history/s-shape-003 (node #2) + NOW kill_by (P6 1–2wk timebox) + ADR-0002 via NOW |

### §WHAT-C — mechanism decomposition: chunked-delta gas stream (the witness rows)

The node's done_when #2 LOCKS "chunked-delta gas stream"; atomically split into one question per
internal parameter (recursive sub-mechanisms re-split). **These are the values ADR-0003 would invent
ad hoc** — minted HERE as named questions instead. Each row shows the PROPERTY side (often `answered`
via I6–I11) and the MAGNITUDE side (`open→PLAN`).

| id | parameter / forced question | property side | magnitude side | tag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | integer/fixed-point field-cell representation (bit-width / fractional scale) so "bit-exact" is well-defined | exact integer truth, no float in authoritative state →G:consistency[lossless], cites I4 | repr / bit-width / scale | **open→PLAN** (prop answered I4) |
| C2 | quantization step **Q** applied to a cell delta before the wire | deterministic one-way quant; recon error/cell ≤ Q; quantized values never overwrite host truth | numeric Q | **open→PLAN** |
| C3 | divergence threshold/bound (lossy mode) — **THE WITNESS SPLIT** | bounded EVERY tick; a provable consequence of deadband+quant, not a tuned knob (cites I8); any tick > bound = recon bug →G:consistency[lossy] | value (recommend = Q) | **split: prop answered I8 · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C4 | deadband magnitude (suppress-small-change threshold) | OFF = lossless oracle / ON = lossy mode (cites I7,I8); shared recon path (I10) | numeric deadband | **open→PLAN** (prop answered I7/I8) |
| C5 | per-client bandwidth clamp | engaged, hard-bounded per client (cites I11) | ~150 KB/s | **open→PLAN** (prop answered I11) |
| C6 | aggregate host bandwidth clamp (across all clients) | engaged, hard-bounded aggregate — the binding uplink limit (cites I11) | ~250–300 KB/s | **open→PLAN** (prop answered I11) |
| C7 | gas-plane channel reliability (unreliable-sequenced vs reliable) — **its OWN decision, not a carryover** | a 2nd plane whose reliability is decided on merits, not inherited from the input bus's reliable design; correctness under the chosen mode must be proven (cites I2) | unreliable-seq vs reliable + config | **split: prop open→G7 · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C8 | settle predicate **N** (dirty-chunks==0 for N ticks) →G:settle | client converges to bit-exact at every settle incl. post-breach; ≥1 real quiescence settle asserted (non-vacuous) (cites I8); resolve must confirm post-breach physical re-equilibration GUARANTEES a network-quiescence settle (else the non-vacuous assertion can fail to fire) →G:settle[network-quiescence] | numeric N | **open→PLAN** (prop answered I8) |
| C9 | keyframe cadence **K** (or quiescence-only) | IF in scope, post-keyframe tick is bit-exact (≥1 non-vacuous); ELSE keyframes out of t-2 = a signed scope boundary | numeric K | **split: prop open→G7(scope) · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C10 | wire / delta payload format + resolution key | each chunk carries a resolution key (unambiguous across tiers); on-wire byte size = the honest first measurement; the FORM survives to the band sim | header/encoding byte layout (fp32/8-bit day-one; fp16 OUT) | **split: prop open→G7-light · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C11 | single-writer-per-(layer×phase) + phase ordering | IF hard-gated, exactly one writer per (layer×phase), proven by a NEGATIVE/seeded-violation test (2nd writer rejected → red), not happy-path | phase table / write-lease form | **split: prop open→G7 · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C12 | revision barrier / change-feed form | REAL exercised contracts (p1-gated, not prose); out-of-order/stale chunk never applied; recover to bit-exact at next settle; survives to band sim →G:chunk[revision] | revision-counter width / barrier encoding | **split: prop open→G7(+p1) · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C13 | chunk loss/reorder fault-injection scope (inject in t-2 vs defer to t-3) | inject → unreliable-path correctness RETIRED; defer → p2 downgrades to clean-channel round-trip, gap-recovery still defined (recommend inject) | seeded drop/reorder schedule | **split: scope open→G7 · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C14 | min-resend interval per chunk (per-chunk rate limiter) — *converge-DERIVED: NOT in NOW's enumerated ADR-0003 list; resolve confirms or drops* | a hot chunk cannot saturate the channel; deterministic send schedule | interval (ticks/ms) | **open→PLAN** |
| C15 | frozen toy-field scene profile (room count, chunk grid, total chunk count) | FROZEN, committed as config/seed; sceneProfileHash pins it; t-3 reuses byte-for-byte; exercised through the REAL registry+feed →G:chunk[chunk-grid] | the concrete counts (decode brief "32/12/2" = scene size ≠ peers) | **split: prop open→G7(repro) · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C16 | reproducibility constants (seed, run length, breach tick, target-tick) | breach fires same tick on all peers (lockstep broadcast); target-tick = MAX aggregate dirty-chunk tick (worst-case, not cherry-picked); validator-reproducible via dotnet+golden vector | seed / runTicks / breachTick / targetTick / pinned 10 Hz (rate answered I21) | **split: prop open→G7(repro) · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C17 | peer count = exactly 1 host + 2 clients = 3 peers | oracle topology fixed; host = single writer, clients reconstruct; distinct from scene size | 3 | **answered** (NOW Reproducibility) |
| C18 | measurement artifact schema + named path (honest dirty-chunk wire bytes + dirty-rate) | honest PEAK-through-breach (NOT steady, NO clamp verdict — t-3); both modes emit distinct non-empty artifacts covering the breach range (dropped mode = FAIL); 0.6–6 KB = logged sanity ref only, not a gate | schema fields + path (e.g. docs/measurements/) | **split: prop open→G7(acceptance) · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C19 | **client-side reconstruction arithmetic determinism** (smuggled inside I1/I4 — folded from verify) — the host core is integer-deterministic (I4) but the CLIENT reconstructs on a SEPARATE path (dequantize→apply→accumulate); bit-exact host-vs-client (I7) + bounded \|client−host\| (I8) BOTH require the client recon arithmetic itself be integer-deterministic + cross-platform-stable | no float dequant; pinned accumulation order; I10 only shares the path across MODES, never asserts the path is deterministic | the dequant/accumulate representation | **split: prop open→G7 · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C20 | **client chunk apply-order / keyframe-vs-delta interleave canonicalization** (deeper than C12 — folded from verify) — C12 fixes WHICH revision wins, not the order a client applies multiple in-revision non-conflicting chunks within one tick, nor keyframe-vs-same-tick-delta interleave; I9 hashes reconstructed cells, so values must be apply-order-INDEPENDENT or a canonical client apply-order pinned (else two clients diverge with NO stale/out-of-order fault) | host hash order (I9) + host write discipline (C11) pinned; CLIENT apply-order is NOT | canonical apply-order / interleave rule | **split: prop open→G7 · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C21 | **layer registry contract** (distinct from C12's revision feed — folded from verify; NOW p1 gates "layer registry + revision feed" as TWO contracts, brief §3.9 component #2) | REAL exercised (p1-gated, not prose); one layer per registration; survives to the band sim →G:chunk[storage] | registry schema / layer-key form | **split: prop open→G7(+p1) · magnitude open→PLAN** |
| C22 | **lossy reconstruction mass-error bound** (crit-3 ↔ stream interaction — folded from verify) — bounded PER-CELL divergence (C3, \|client−host\|≤Q) does NOT imply bounded TOTAL-MASS error: N deadband-suppressed cells each ≤Q sum to N·Q aggregate drift (the brief §3.5 FATAL-2 remainder-bucket exists for exactly this) | must decide whether lossy recon CONSERVES mass exactly / within a stated bound, or only DISPLAYS it (A2.2); contract survives to band sim | the conservation bound / remainder-bucket form | **split: prop open→G7 · magnitude open→PLAN** |

*(Cross-refs, not re-opened: hash-domain = I9 (answered); client-reconstructs-without-sim = I1
(answered, but its determinism is now C19); late-join scope = I20 (answered).)*

A single contract living in two siblings' done_when, named by neither node alone | open→arch (cross-cutting invariant) |

---

## §COVERAGE MAP — three-source closure (every criterion + edge + mechanism parameter → a row)

**(a) done_when criteria → rows** (no white spots):

| criterion | covered by |
|---|---|
| 1 — min-spec performance | A1.1–A1.6 |
| 2 — replication model locked + chunked-delta | I1, I2, I3, I11, **I23** (model + rollback/lockstep spike bound) + **§WHAT-C C1–C22** (the parameters the locked model forces) |
| 3 — 2+ clients consistent across topology change + debug surfaces | I6–I11 (consistency oracle) + C3, C8, C9, C13, **C19, C20, C22** (settle/divergence/keyframe/fault + client-recon determinism + apply-order + lossy mass-bound) + A2.1–A2.4 (debug surfaces, mass invariant, video, evidence split) + G:topology-change, G:settle |
| 4 — declarative two-level gas types | I12, I13 (R5/R15) + A3.1–A3.5 + B1, B2 |
| 5 — reusable agent-drivable harness | I4, I5 + A4.1–A4.3 + C15, C18, **C21** (scene profile, telemetry schema, layer registry) |
| 6 — render proof slice locks stylization + seam | I19 + A5.1–A5.6 + B9 |
| 7 — clean 1-player, count = config, no bots | I5, I14 + A6.1–A6.2 |
| 8 — first spectacular clip milestone | A7.1–A7.3 + B15, B18 *(B20 is e6f2 steady-cadence, NOT the milestone — dropped)* |
| 9 — scale architecture (R1) arithmetic-validated | I15, I16, I17 (always-on / latency / stratification) + A8.1–A8.8 (incl. energy/temperature state dim) + A1.7 (whole-frame budget closure) + B30 (topology) + C18 (measured chunk size feeds bandwidth arithmetic) |

**(b) cross-node edges → rows:** B1–B31 (g-d3a8: B1–B8; g-7e15: B9–B14; g-5b07: B15–B19; g-e6f2:
B20–B22; root: B23–B26; DA/PGG/vendor: B27–B29; destruction-consumer: B30; **shared field-sampling
oracle: B31**). No sibling edge unmapped.

**(c) mechanism parameters → rows:** chunked-delta stream fully decomposed in §WHAT-C C1–C22
(I9/I1/I20 cross-referenced for hash-domain / reconstruct / late-join). Recursive sub-mechanisms split:
deadband+quantization (C2,C3,C4), flow-control clamps (C5,C6), the channel (C7), keyframe/resend
recovery (C8,C9,C13), the chunk wire format (C10), write discipline (C11), the fabric contracts =
**layer registry (C21) + revision barrier/change-feed (C12)** (two contracts, per NOW p1 — not one),
**client-side reconstruction determinism (C19) + apply-order canonicalization (C20)** (the second,
client code path I1/I4 left implicit), and **lossy mass-conservation (C22)**. No parameter folded
silently into a closed mechanism (design-doc fix b honored).

### WITNESS CHECK — the success test (does the set name as QUESTIONS exactly the ADR-0003 ad-hoc values?)

Each value PLAN would freeze ad hoc in ADR-0003 (extracted independently from NOW.md
`next.leg_opens_with`, s-work-004, converge-design.md) → the row that now NAMES it as a question:

| ADR-0003 ad-hoc value | named here as | kind |
|---|---|---|
| integer/fixed-point field representation | **C1** | magnitude→PLAN |
| quantization step Q | **C2** | magnitude→PLAN |
| divergence threshold (property "bounded by quant step") | I8 / **C3** property | property→G7 (answered) |
| divergence threshold value = Q | **C3** magnitude | magnitude→PLAN |
| deadband magnitude | **C4** | magnitude→PLAN |
| per-client clamp (~150 KB/s) | **C5** | magnitude→PLAN |
| aggregate host clamp (~250–300 KB/s) | **C6** | magnitude→PLAN |
| gas-plane channel reliability (unreliable-seq vs reliable) | **C7** | own-decision→PLAN/G7 |
| settle predicate N | **C8** | magnitude→PLAN |
| keyframe cadence K (or quiescence-only) | **C9** | magnitude→PLAN / scope |
| wire byte-format + resolution key | **C10** | magnitude→PLAN |
| single-writer-per-(layer×phase) + phase ordering | **C11** | property→G7 / form→PLAN |
| revision barrier / change-feed form | **C12** | property→G7 / form→PLAN |
| fault-injection scope (inject t-2 vs defer t-3) | **C13** | scope→G7 |
| frozen scene profile (rooms, chunk grid, total) | **C15** | magnitude→PLAN |
| reproducibility constants (seed, run, breach, target-tick) | **C16** | magnitude→PLAN |
| peer count = 1 host + 2 clients | **C17** | answered |
| measurement schema + path (bytes + dirty-rate) | **C18** | magnitude→PLAN |
| late-join out of scope | I20 | answered (scope) |
| dual-guarantee kill-gate "A" | I6 | property (answered) |
| lossless (i) bit-exact incl. breach | I7 | property (answered) |
| lossy (ii) bounded-divergence + settle-converge | I8 | property (answered) |
| hash domain = reconstructed field cells only | I9 | property (answered) |
| same reconstruction code path (anti-gaming) | I10 | property (answered) |
| client reconstructs without running the sim | I1 | property (answered) |
| tick rate pinned 10 Hz day-one | I21 / C16 | answered |
| 0.6–6 KB sanity-only, no clamp verdict in t-2 | C18 property | answered (scope) |
| G0 ledger frozen / default-FAIL / builder-can't-edit | I22 | process (answered) |
| rollback/lockstep ≤ one 1–2-wk spike (crit-2 sub-clause) | I23 | property (answered) |
| layer registry (a contract distinct from the revision feed) | C21 | property→G7 / form→PLAN |
| revision barrier / change-feed = REAL exercised contracts | C12 (p1-gated) | property→G7 |

**Verdict: PASS (mechanical), independently confirmed.** A separate adversarial verify pass
(wf_f79c2059-b21: coverage / witness / firewall / completeness, attacking the set) found `missing_values:
[]` against an independently-rebuilt gold list — every value ADR-0003 would invent ad hoc IS present as
a named row: the previously-decided properties as `answered` imports (I1–I23), every open MAGNITUDE
(Q, deadband, both clamps, N, K, channel reliability, wire format, scene profile, repro constants,
fault-injection) as an `open→PLAN`/scope row in §WHAT-C. The values are no longer invented at task time;
they are the converge set's open agenda for PLAN.

**Beyond the gold list (the layer earning its keep):** the verify pass surfaced FOUR forced parameters
that even the hardened c-exec-003 CALL left implicit inside `answered` rows — C19 (client-side recon
arithmetic determinism), C20 (client apply-order canonicalization), C22 (lossy mass-conservation bound),
C21 (the layer registry as a contract distinct from the revision feed) — plus C14 (min-resend, converge-
derived). These are NOT in NOW's enumerated ADR-0003 list; the decomposition (not the success bar) caught
them. A real ADR-0003 hits C19/C20/C22 immediately. This is the layer doing exactly its job: catching
what a same-session self-check would have smuggled. *(Honest scope of "PASS": this is the FORM-pass
mechanical coverage claim, hardened by one adversarial pass. The FULL independent-oracle completeness
sweep + "no answer leans on an uncovered question" trace is the separate converge-verify session — NOT
run here, per boundary.)*

---

## §ROUTE — next + the live-build sequencing risk (⚠ surfaced to owner)

The next movement is **converge-arch** (heavy + sibling-bearing: the B-rows are consumer-driven cross-node
contracts) and **resolve-one-question-at-a-time** for the open→G7 rows; converge-verify gates shape later.

**⚠ Sequencing risk (verify pass, → owner decision d-converge-001).** The bulk of the OPEN rows are
`open→PLAN` magnitudes (C1–C22) — and those are **exactly** the values the ALREADY-DISPATCHED `c-exec-003`
leg will freeze in ADR-0003 (`NOW.next.leg_opens_with` enumerates Q/N/K/clamps/scene-profile/repro). This
retrofit set was authored in PARALLEL to that in-flight build (CALL boundary: don't touch the bet). So
ADR-0003 could freeze C1–C22 **before** this converge set (and the converge-arch B-row properties they must
satisfy — the shared field-sampling oracle B31, the lossy mass bound C22, client-recon determinism C19/C20)
is consumed — letting PLAN re-invent precisely what this pass exists to pre-empt. This is the FIRST-RUN
demonstration question the design doc names (slice #2): does converge merely *reproduce* the ad-hoc list as
a proof, or does it *feed* the live ADR-0003? Touching the bet is an owner call → `decisions_needed`.

## §RESOLVED — owner sign-off (2026-06-14, session s-converge-002)

`§SIGNOFF: owner approved RESOLVE (temperature + destruction + extensibility) @ 2026-06-14 — "да, A" +
R1–R13 confirmed (voice, this session).` Three design questions closed below. They re-shape the bet →
shape card c-shape-004 (owner approved the DIRECTION "A"; the specific re-shaped done_when needs G9
in-session approval). HOW magnitudes still → PLAN; reaction CONTENT stays g-d3a8.

**RESOLVED-1 — TEMPERATURE** (supersedes I21 "static field day-one"; closes A8.8; new term G:temperature):
Temperature is a **thin DYNAMIC LAYER** in the core — its own data structure + its own minimal optimized
sim, a sibling of gas (R2/R3), **not static**. It talks only through the grid event/revision bus: events
(reaction / gas-spread / breach, by coordinates) flow through the grid; temperature **subscribes** and
responds — rises then decays (R4). Its job in the core is to **prove the layered architecture supports
adding layers + cross-system interaction** (R5), **not** gameplay/aesthetics — temperature gameplay design
→ g-d3a8 (R1). Only in this form (R6). *Grounding:* the seam already anticipates it — reaction batches
carry enthalpy and reactions read a temperature window (brief §3.2), so temperature↔reactions is a natural
loop; keep the sim TRIVIAL (scalar rise/decay). Sim structure/magnitude → PLAN.

**RESOLVED-2 — DESTRUCTION** (supersedes I21 "scripted-breach only"; B30; G:destruction/G:topology-change
"scripted" reading): **No scripted breach.** Real but **CONTROLLED, LOCAL** destructibility in the core: a
destructible wall is breached (explosion / player) → a hole opens → topology changes → gas flows out
(R7/R8). Few walls, count TBD. **No collapse / structural physics / level-wide change** (R9). Shards/
fragments (tied to loot-with-gas carry, trip-over) = deferred super-extra (R10). *Grounding:* maps exactly
onto the designed topology-change = "add a breach portal between immutable volumes" (brief §3.7) — only the
TRIGGER changes from scripted to real-controlled; no architecture change needed.

**RESOLVED-3 — EXTENSIBILITY** (R11/R12/R13, governing principle): everything in the core is built so ALL
of it can be extended later (each system, esp. temperature, gains functionality). **Healthy form
(owner-confirmed):** make the **SEAMS/abstractions extensible** (cheap to extend later); keep
**IMPLEMENTATIONS minimal now** (do NOT build future functionality early — that breaks G3 / the 24.07
wall). No scripted finals; simplest impls only for tests. *Grounding:* already the spine — engine-free
core, layer registry + named extension points (a new layer/driver plugs in without core edits), R4
"asset survives the concept".

## §SIGNOFF — partial (resolve in progress)

G7 owner gates batched into AT MOST THREE points (one per gated movement):

- `§SIGNOFF: Define (glossary readings) — PENDING` (a resolve pass signs the remaining disputed-term readings).
- `§SIGNOFF: Resolve (WHAT acceptance) — PARTIAL` — temperature / destruction / extensibility SIGNED 2026-06-14 (s-converge-002, see §RESOLVED); remaining open→G7 rows still pending.
- `§SIGNOFF: converge-arch (cross-node contracts) — PENDING` (the B-rows ride converge-arch).

Remaining open rows are still the deliverable for later resolve/arch/verify; converge-verify NOT run.

## play_check (FORM pass)

- `triage: HEAVY — converge ON — model? YES · contract? YES · decomposes? YES` (done; verify-confirmed SOUND)

- `close & route: NOT a full close — FORM-pass checkpoint; next = converge-arch (grid↔gas / gas-type seam / render seam / ingestion / B31 oracle) AND/OR resolve-one-at-a-time; ⚠ §ROUTE sequencing decision d-converge-001 surfaced (feed live c-exec-003 PLAN before ADR-0003 freezes C1–C22?). converge-verify gates shape later.` (checkpoint)
- `verify (the converge-verify PLAY): DEFERRED to a separate session (boundary — not run here); the internal hardening pass above is a self-check, NOT the independent-oracle converge-verify`

### A. Ingestion adapter / TopologyDocument (B27–B29) — PRIMARY

- **IN1 — Structure-ingestion (TopologyDocument).** B27. *TopologyCore (#1) ← structure generator behind the
  replaceable adapter (DA day-one).* trigger: level (re)generation / scene load (not per-tick). **OBSERVABLE:**
  TopologyCore requires a complete static structure description sufficient to sectorize geometrically AND to
  support exact-source-tracking + on-entry reconstruction — volumes {stable id, archetype incl. hangar/
  openSpace, bounds extent, free volume, floor/ceiling extent}, portals {position, facing, opening size,
  **lower-edge height above floor** = the fact that lets a low opening vent heavy gas first}, surfaces
  {vertical span, **breachable** flag}, anchors, subdivision intent; ids **logically identical + deterministic
  across peers** from the same generation; vertical carried explicitly even where the generator API is 2D.
  Self-contained: TopologyCore sectorizes + runs seal/closure with ZERO gas-domain inputs. acceptance:
  re-ingest same level → logically-identical ids + identical vertical extents on every peer; sectorization-
  complete with zero gas inputs. `→PLAN`: occupancy present/absent day-one (optional naive ~100–300 vs bet-2
  occupancy+1000-gate); occupancy encoding/basisCellSize; AABB struct layout; doc serialization; subdivision
  threshold magnitudes. bounds: B27, A8.1, A8.7. build: produced-now-consumed-later (DA behind seam day-one —
  not dangling). canon: TopologyDocument-ingestion (read_by TopologyCore + DA/PGG adapters). *[fix: "byte-
  identical ids" → "logically identical" — byte layout belongs to the LOCKED wire, not this contract.]*
- **IN2 — Adapter-replaceability invariant.** B27/B28. *TopologyCore ← the replaceable adapter seam.* trigger:
  a generator swap. **OBSERVABLE:** the structure is defined ENTIRELY by the TopologyDocument contract (IN1),
  never by the generator's identity/internals; swapping the generator (DA→PGG→any) changes only WHICH document
  is produced, never its shape; replaceability demonstrated on the DAY-ONE generator alone (PGG parked behind
  the SAME seam; population OUT of scope now per d-generator-001). acceptance (black-box): any two conforming
  producers of the same logical level → identical sectorization + seal verdicts; the SOLE admission gate is a
  conformance check (sectorization-complete + deterministic), the day-one generator passing it is sufficient.
  `→PLAN`: adapter interface signature; conformance check site/test-vectors; whether PGG population maps to
  occupancy vs a later doc extension. bounds: B28, A8.7. build: internal. canon: ingestion-adapter-
  replaceability. *[fix: black-box acceptance — dropped the white-box "no generator-specific branch".]*
- **IN3 — Transport-vendor swap.** B29. *g-9c41 networked core ← transport vendor (FishNet default / NGO|NfE
  fallback) behind a transport-adapter.* trigger: a vendor swap. **OBSERVABLE:** swapping the vendor causes NO
  change to the component tree, the gas-field stream plane, or any gas/domain contract; the gas field rides a
  SECOND own plane never retrofitted onto the vendor's input/entity transport; no vendor type named outside the
  adapter. acceptance: a vendor swap leaves the tree + gas/domain contracts unchanged AND the gas-consistency
  oracle (lossless+lossy under drop/delay/reorder) passes identically. `→PLAN`: adapter signature; default/
  fallback config; channel-reliability config knobs around the LOCKED unreliable-sequenced mode; per-vendor
  binding. bounds: B29, I3, C7. build: internal. canon: transport-vendor-decoupling.

### B. grid↔gas internal seam (PRIMARY)

- **GG1 — Topology-change feed.** internal #1→#3. *GasDomain ← TopologyAuthority.* trigger: a committed
  topology change (revision advances). **OBSERVABLE:** on every topology change GasDomain receives the changed
  sectors + new adjacency (added/removed portals), each labelled with the topology-revision, on a SINGLE agreed
  tick every peer observes identically; between changes geometry/adjacency are immutable; change-sets are
  self-describing (a consumer at revision r given the change-set to r+1 reaches r+1 with no host-private state)
  + replayable. acceptance: determinism-of-tick (every peer reports the same tick a revision takes effect);
  revision-monotonic (strictly increasing, no unreconstructable gap); replay-identity. `→PLAN`: push-vs-poll;
  deferred-commit P1→P2 (the agreed-tick mechanism); change-set encoding + revision-counter width; feed
  reliability; cadence; replay history depth. bounds: C12, C16, A2.1. build: internal. canon: G:topology-change
  (read_by TopologyCore + GasDomain). **NOTE:** this topology-revision is the SECTOR/adjacency sibling counter
  (brief §3.4 "external revision = published tick"), DISTINCT from the LOCKED per-(layerKey,chunkIndex) field
  barrier — not in conflict.
- **GG2 — Geometry/band sovereignty split.** internal #1→#3. **OBSERVABLE:** every change-set is purely
  geometric, keyed by sector id — never names a band/species/mass/concentration; GasDomain attaches its own
  per-sector band state to a sector id and the attachment survives non-destructive topology changes; conversely
  NO GasDomain field is an input to producing a change-set (TopologyCore computes the next change-set with zero
  gas knowledge). acceptance: independence-of-domains (perturb gas → identical change-set stream); vocabulary-
  closure (no gas field in the change-set schema); key-stability (a sector id survives a non-destructive change
  so band state isn't orphaned). `→PLAN`: geometric field list; sector-id encoding; band-state indexing. bounds:
  A3.4, C21. build: internal. canon: Sovereignty (geometry-only, keyed by sector id).
- **GG3 — Real controlled breach → vertical portals.** B30/RESOLVED-2. internal #1→#3 (GasDomain consumer).
  trigger: a real controlled LOCAL breach (explosion/player) on a breachable surface; no scripted, no collapse.
  **OBSERVABLE:** on the agreed topology-change tick, one+ NEW portals appear in the affected sectors' adjacency,
  each with a breach-portal identity that is deterministic + stable (same breach/inputs → same identity on every
  peer + across replay; present in snapshot + change-set); after applied, gas transport across the new portal is
  enabled; the breach changes geometry only. acceptance: breach-causes-flow (no outflow before, an outflow path
  on the first tick after applied); identity-determinism; same-tick agreement (inherits GG1). `→PLAN`: breach-
  portal id encoding (surfaceId,ordinal); deferred-commit timing; portal geometric byte layout; #breachable
  walls day-one (count TBD per RESOLVED-2); the orifice/sill flow MECHANISM. bounds: C16, B30, A8.x sillZ flow.
  build: internal. canon: **G:topology-change[breach] — ONE shared line with CS1** (read_by g-9c41 +
  destruction-consumer).
- **GG4 — Band-handoff support (OWNER-SIGNED, see §SIGNOFF-BH).** band-handoff steer + R10. internal #1→#3.
  trigger: (a) a source/emitter exists in a coarse-simulated sector; (b) a player enters → fine detail demanded.
  **OBSERVABLE (resolved per owner):** GasDomain can pin an emitter/source to an EXACT intra-sector location +
  identity, preserved across non-destructive topology changes, AND on player-entry reconstruct a local field
  that is roughly right in amount + direction + which corner — to a **LOOSE gameplay tolerance** (a few cells;
  metric exactness is NOT measured), with the **coarse tier as the source of truth**. acceptance (firm): (1)
  **NO visible discontinuity/shimmer on the coarse↔fine handoff** (the owner's hard 100% requirement); (2) a
  weak corner source reads in the right corner with roughly-right, slowly-accumulated magnitude when the player
  returns after leaving; (3) source-survival across non-destructive topology change. The geometry the seam
  exposes must SUFFICE for this; the reconstruction mechanism is not prescribed. `→PLAN`: the 3-tier prep-window
  mechanism (owner HINT: coarse=truth / intermediate prep-window within a radius / fine close-up — a hunch, not
  a lock); hints-vs-replay; the few-cells tolerance magnitude; how source-accumulation is hinted while coarse;
  burn-in/seeding to achieve no-pop; seam smoothing. bounds: A8.1/A8.2, C15, B27 occupancy. build: internal.
  canon: band-handoff continuity. *(twin of OR4 — same owner decision, one §SIGNOFF.)*

### C. B31 — the ONE normative field-sampling / ExposureQuery oracle (the cross-cutting invariant; PRIMARY)

- **OR1 — Single-oracle field sampling.** B31/B11. *g-7e15 visual read model + g-d3a8 far-AI ExposureQuery ←
  g-9c41 GasDomain (IGasReadModel).* trigger: any consumer samples concentration at a point for a published
  revision. **OBSERVABLE:** ONE published read view; any two consumers querying the SAME point at the SAME
  published revision get the SAME concentration for the SAME species — regardless of consumer AND regardless of
  which tier (fine/intermediate/coarse) is the thinnest open level there; the answer is a pure function of
  (point, species, revision). acceptance: cross-consumer agreement (visual read view == ExposureQuery at the
  same point); a NAMED cross-tier agreement test at points where the thinnest-open-level differs; determinism.
  `→PLAN`: the sub-band interpolation math; whether/how it composes across a resolution boundary; agreement
  tolerance (bit-exact vs ε); resolution-key encoding; push-vs-pull; memory layout. bounds: C1, C10, A1.7/B12,
  A8.8. build: produced-now-consumed-later. canon: IGasReadModel single-oracle invariant (read_by g-7e15 crit-2
  + g-d3a8 crit-5). **HIGH-RISK property authored observable-first: if PLAN cannot satisfy it at a seam → a
  BLOCKED contract, not a silent green.**
- **OR2 — Point-resolution rule (thinnest open level).** B31/B11. *all three consumers ← GasDomain.*
  **OBSERVABLE:** a point covered by several levels answers from the THINNEST open level (fine > intermediate >
  coarse band); the selection is part of the contract (a consumer never chooses a tier, never sees a different
  tier than another consumer for the same point); exactly one concentration per (point,species,revision); which
  level supplied it is observable. acceptance: single-valued; precedence-honored (fine inside an open window,
  coarse outside); consumer-independence; no gaps (coarse = floor). `→PLAN`: precedence structure; window-
  boundary/seam assignment; resolution-key scheme. bounds: C10, A8.2, T3>T2>T1s budgets. build: internal. canon:
  point-resolution (thinnest-open-level).
- **OR3 — ExposureQuery = volume integral of the one oracle.** B31. *g-d3a8 far-AI lethality + self-play
  (crit-5) ← GasDomain.* **OBSERVABLE:** exposure for an actor occupying a VOLUME = aggregating the same
  per-point concentration (OR1) over the actor's volume via the same resolution rule (OR2); the far-AI verdict
  and a self-play run on the same actor/revision/config get the SAME exposure; never reads a private/differently-
  resolved state. acceptance: ExposureQuery over a degenerate (point) volume == OR1 point answer; self-
  consistency across runs + across the two g-d3a8 lanes; tier-independence for a straddling actor; a named
  volume-sum cross-check. `→PLAN`: integration/quadrature; actor-volume representation; exposure units/dose; the
  **lethality threshold = g-d3a8 design content + a PLAN number, NOT this contract**; pull vs subscription.
  bounds: C22, A8.6, C1. build: produced-now-consumed-later. canon: ExposureQuery = volume integral.
- **OR4 — Player-near seeding agrees on entry (band-handoff, OWNER-SIGNED).** B31. *g-9c41 band-handoff seeding
  ← GasDomain.* The B31-side twin of GG4 — resolved together (§SIGNOFF-BH): opening a fine window changes
  RESOLUTION not the ANSWER to a LOOSE gameplay tolerance, with NO visible shimmer; a weak corner source is
  roughly right on arrival; the coarse oracle is the source of truth the fine tier derives from. acceptance:
  handoff continuity to gameplay tolerance + no pop (firm); source fidelity (right corner, roughly-right slowly-
  accumulated magnitude); conservation consistent with the read view's mass accounting. `→PLAN`: seeding
  mechanism (reconstruct-from-source / replay / spatial-hints — brief §3.5); burn-in; coarse-source accumulation
  hint; tolerance magnitude. bounds: C22, §3.5 window-drag/burn-in, A8.8. build: produced-now-consumed-later.
  canon: band-handoff continuity.

### D. Cross-layer interaction + extensibility seam (done_when #10 — the WHITE SPOT the miner gap-hunt caught; NEW)

- **XL1 — Cross-layer interaction seam (multi-layer consistency).** done_when #10 + RESOLVED-1 + the LOCKED
  cross-layer contract. INTERNAL: GasDomain/ReactionLayer (LayerKey 0) PUBLISHES reaction/breach/gas-changed
  GridEvents; the temperature layer (LayerKey 1) SUBSCRIBES + responds. trigger: a layer publishes a GridEvent
  another layer consumes within a tick. **OBSERVABLE:** ≥2 independent layers ride ONE seam and are networked-
  consistent TOGETHER — the non-simulating client reconstructs a consistent MULTI-LAYER field (both gas and
  temperature held to the lossless bit-exact + lossy bounded-divergence oracle at settle, per the LOCK's
  CellHash.FoldLayer-per-layer); a cross-layer interaction is OBSERVABLE (a reaction/heat event drives the
  temperature layer's response, measurable at the firing tick). acceptance: under the load oracle, BOTH layers'
  reconstructed cells stay host==clients at every settle; a suppressed-event negative oracle shows the
  interaction is real; (crit-10 tightening, folded by shape) a FEEDBACK interaction (not a pure sink) is
  exercised. `→PLAN`: the phase ordering + cross-layer revision/commit rule for a feedback interaction; per-layer
  Q/N magnitudes; the specific feedback rule + its constant. bounds: C11, C12, C19/C20, A8.8. build: internal.
  **NOTE — consistency obligation DECIDED (not an open fork):** the binding obligation = (a) BOTH layers
  consistent together. done_when #10 says "networked-consistent together"; ADR-0004 §T12 already proved
  temperature consistent at settle for the Wave-1 sink; the cheaper "gas-only + host-derived temperature"
  reading would WEAKEN crit-10 and contradict the LOCK → rejected. canon: G:cross-layer-consistency (read_by
  FieldFabric + GasDomain + the temperature layer).
- **XL2 — Layer-registry extensibility ("a new layer plugs in without core edits").** done_when #10 +
  RESOLVED-3 + C21. INTERNAL: a new independent layer registers on FieldFabric (#2) and rides the shared
  transactional multi-layer commit + revision feed. trigger: a new layer/driver registered at composition/load.
  **OBSERVABLE:** a temperature-CLASS WHOLE layer (distinct from a within-gas species handler — GT1) registers
  via the layer registry (one layer per registration, keyed by LayerKey asc) and participates in the shared
  store + revision feed WITHOUT editing FieldFabric or any other layer's files (file-level isolation = the
  extensibility proof). acceptance: a gas-only run reproduces the goldens; a gas+new-layer run keeps the gas
  trajectory byte-identical + an RNG-conservation guard proves the new layer consumed zero gas RNG (the Wave-1
  C21 proof, generalized); a third DEMONSTRATIVE layer plugs in with no core edit (crit-10 tightening — currently
  argued, not exercised). `→PLAN`: registry schema / layer-key form; the barrier table re-size for >2 layers
  (the LOCK requires re-sizing the [layerCount=2,chunkCount=4] table — a HOW this contract forces); per-layer
  store attach. bounds: C21, C11, LOCK barrier-table sizing. build: internal. **NOTE:** distinct from GT1 (the
  gas-DOMAIN species handler that writes source/sink INTO the gas field); XL2 is the FieldFabric-kernel WHOLE-
  LAYER registration seam — the two were conflated in the first draft; separated here. canon:
  G:layer-registry-extensibility (read_by FieldFabric + any future layer author).

### E. Gas-type extension seam (B1–B6, B8; consumer g-d3a8 — SECONDARY)

- **GT1 — Meta-gas handler seam.** B1/B3. *g-d3a8 ← GasDomain (SpeciesDriverRegistry #9 + IDriverReadView +
  phase scheduler).* **OBSERVABLE:** any meta-gas handler g-d3a8 supplies, at registration DECLARES the layers/
  species it owns + read/write scopes; at run time is the SOLE writer of its declared layers within its phase,
  READS the world only via a phase-consistent POST-TRANSPORT read-view, and CONTRIBUTES only scalar source/sink
  on its owned species (may not mutate other layers/topology/committed truth); a handler writing outside its
  declared scope/phase is REJECTED; the world view is the same regardless of which other handlers are present.
  acceptance: phase isolation (disjoint-layer handlers identical alone or together); out-of-scope write rejected
  by a negative test; determinism of the seam. `→PLAN`: phase count/ordering; write-lease/token structure; read-
  view copy mechanism/layout; owned-layer count caps; registration-record encoding. bounds: A3.1, A3.4, C11,
  C21. build: produced-now-consumed-later. canon: G:meta-gas-seam.
- **GT2 — Data-alone config + harness acceptance.** B2. **OBSERVABLE:** a gas reusing an existing archetype is
  expressible as DATA ALONE (shared-parent params + per-meta-gas params + per-meta-gas procedural visual, R15) —
  no config field carries code; a gas needing behavior the archetypes can't express is the observable trigger to
  add a handler (GT1); binding acceptance = a third gas type by data alone lands + PASSES THE HARNESS with no
  core edit; a config smuggling behavior outside the property set is rejected. `→PLAN`: config schema fields/
  types; value ranges/defaults; procedural-visual param encoding; species-id scheme; serialization. bounds: A3.2,
  A3.3, A3.4, A3.5. build: produced-now-consumed-later. canon: G:gas-config-acceptance. *[fix: "packing density",
  not "per-cell packing", to keep the example behavioral, not a layout commitment.]*
- **GT3 — Declarative reaction registry.** B4. **OBSERVABLE:** reactions DECLARED in INTENSIVE terms
  (concentration fractions + a temperature/energy window) so the SAME rule fires identically at coarse-band or
  fine-cell scale, with hysteresis (anti-chatter); each region's reaction evaluated at exactly ONE level per
  tick (no double-count); outputs = species-mass changes applied conservatively with all same-tick changes +
  typed consequence events (GT4); a reaction changing a species' class just edits the local mixture (no desync
  surface). acceptance: level-independence; exclusivity (a region under coarse+fine counted once, provable by a
  would-double-count test); conservation within the stated bound when summed with transport. `→PLAN`: threshold/
  hysteresis magnitudes (+3K/−1.5K class); rate caps (per-second); stoichiometric batch encoding; arbiter sort
  key + scaling; enthalpy/radiative constants. bounds: A2.2, C22, A8.8. build: produced-now-consumed-later.
  canon: G:reaction-intensive.
- **GT4 — Consequence/event plane.** B5. **OBSERVABLE:** consequence events are typed + SELF-CONTAINED (location/
  magnitude/species) so a consumer needs NO field state; proximity-INDEPENDENT; carry a publication revision
  (baseline-at-R + events-after-R recovery); guaranteed to reach consumers AHEAD of the lossy field
  reconstruction of the same change (systematically outrun lossy chunks; never on the gas stream); end-to-end
  latency BOUNDED. acceptance: a no-field-state consumer reconstructs the consequence from the event alone; under
  field-stream loss/delay the event still arrives before/independently of the field depiction; ordering/revision
  lets a missed consumer recover exactly; observable within the latency bound. `→PLAN`: the latency-bound NUMBER
  (sim ≤100 ms / perceived 100–300 ms, I16); event encoding + revision-counter width; delivery channel/
  reliability (RPC/ghost); baseline+delta encoding; queue sizing. bounds: A2.1, C12, I16. build: produced-now-
  consumed-later. canon: G:event-plane. **NOTE:** rides the LOCKED revisioned cross-layer GridEvent bus +
  reliable feed (not re-opened). This is the OUTBOUND gameplay-consequence plane to g-d3a8 — DISTINCT from XL1
  (the in-core gas↔temperature subscription).
- **GT5 — Flagship custom-driver + named exclusions.** B8. **OBSERVABLE:** a flagship gas may ship a CUSTOM
  driver via the SAME seam (GT1) and carry per-meta-gas visual params from which its look is DERIVED (published
  so a visual consumer renders it from sim state, not a side channel); day-one the seam admits ONLY field-
  transported gases — a gas hitting an excluded capability (agent/self-directed substrate; directed-velocity
  intent) is REJECTED at registration with the exclusion named, never silently degraded. acceptance: a flagship
  custom-driver passes the same seam acceptance as GT1 + renders only from published params; an excluded-
  capability request is rejected; the excluded modes carry no day-one implementation. `→PLAN`: capability-
  declaration encoding; driver-state blob format; procedural-visual param ranges; **whether agent-substrate
  persists as a declared-but-unbuilt MODE (brief §5) or is fully REMOVED per the R5 reframe (I12)** — see fork;
  velocity-gating wiring. bounds: A3.1, A3.4, R15, I12. build: produced-now-consumed-later. **owner_fork
  (parked-sibling, DEFAULT taken):** agent-substrate as a first-class 2nd registration pathway vs forever-parked
  single field pathway → DEFAULT = single field pathway, agent-substrate not a day-one shape (per I12/R5
  "AGENT_SUBSTRATE removed", risk-#1 gating); the 2nd-pathway question is deferred to **g-d3a8's own converge**,
  NOT a Wave-2 fork. canon: G:gas-exclusions-dayone.
- **(B6 self-play lane) — RECLASSIFIED, not a separate cross-node contract.** The agent-self-play validation
  lane is a g-9c41-INTERNAL validation discipline (harness + asserting agent both inside g-9c41's test surface).
  Its cross-node observable (same config → same answer in self-play as in the live read model) is already carried
  by OR3 (ExposureQuery self-consistency across the two g-d3a8 lanes) + GT2 (harness acceptance). Recorded as a
  g-9c41-internal acceptance row (crit-5 lane), not a converge-arch contract. *[fix: the firewall critic flagged
  the drafted K5 as a producer-side spec wearing a contract label — demoted here.]*

### F. Render-pipeline seam (B9–B14; consumer g-7e15 — SECONDARY)

- **RN1 — Read-model + pipeline-swap seam.** B11/B9. *g-7e15 ← GasDomain read model (the B31 oracle).*
  **OBSERVABLE:** the visual pipeline samples sim state ONLY through the published read model — it asks the SAME
  normative B31 oracle (REFERENCE by name; the formula is NOT restated here) and gets concentrations/species at a
  point for the current published revision, tagged with the revision + the resolution level that answered;
  choosing/swapping the concrete render pipeline (URP/HDRP/custom, A5.2) changes no producer-side type/signature/
  behavior. acceptance: B31 same-point-same-answer; replacing the render pipeline with the sim build unchanged
  leaves every read-model sample identical; every sample self-describes its revision + resolving level. `→PLAN`:
  push-vs-poll; sample-result layout; resolutionKey encoding + tier thresholds; the interpolation form; cadence;
  the URP/HDRP/custom pick. bounds: A5.2, A5.1, Q/band/tier C-rows. build: produced-now-consumed-later. canon:
  visual-reads-via-published-read-model. *[fix: the B31 formula was inlined in the draft — removed; reference by
  name only.]*
- **RN2 — Visuals are a derivation of sim state (blind-check).** B13/B14/B9. **OBSERVABLE:** for any captured
  moment g-9c41 exposes a machine-readable ground-truth readout (derived from the read model): how many gases +
  where, where it's dangerous (lethal-exposure regions via ExposureQuery), where gas flows; the visual output
  (incl. flagship menace silhouette + motion) must be a DERIVATION of this state — a blind vision-agent reading
  the rendered clip agrees with the ground truth; menace motion is sim-driven, NOT hand-staged VFX. acceptance:
  blind-check over a captured clip matches the ground-truth readout; same revision sequence → same blind-check
  verdict (reproducible from state). `→PLAN`: ground-truth artifact schema; blind-check tolerances; lethal-
  exposure threshold; clip resolution/format/path (g-5b07 B15); the stylization amplitude g-7e15 may add. bounds:
  A5.5, A5.1, A7.1 (only on a derived-not-faked clip), lethal-exposure C-row. build: produced-now-consumed-later.
  **owner_fork (parked-sibling, DEFAULT taken):** menace-motion STRICT derivation (g-7e15 may only stylize an
  existing sim-driven motion) vs HYBRID (bounded authored secondary motion on top) → DEFAULT = STRICT (crit-6
  default, safer claim); deferred to **g-7e15's converge**, NOT a Wave-2 fork. canon: visuals-derive-from-state.
- **RN3 — Per-meta-gas visual params from the driver read-view.** B10. **OBSERVABLE:** per meta-gas at a sampled
  point, g-9c41 publishes (via IDriverReadView) the param set that makes the gas visually DISTINGUISHABLE (R15:
  shared-parent + per-meta-gas + procedural-visual params), read from sim config/driver state, NOT invented in
  the renderer; a config-only new gas surfaces its distinguishability params with no producer code change; two
  distinct meta-gases yield distinguishable param sets (the property the RN2 "how many gases" blind-check relies
  on). acceptance: which params are exposed is a function of config (a data-alone gas exposes visuals with zero
  producer/renderer edit); read-view phase-consistent (no torn cross-species reads); distinct gases →
  distinguishable params. `→PLAN`: visual param schema field list; ranges/defaults; the procedural-visual
  generation function (g-7e15-side HOW); read-view layout/cadence. bounds: A3.2, A3.4, R15, A3.1. build: produced-
  now-consumed-later. canon: per-gas-visual-from-published-params.
- **RN4 — Shared min-spec frame budget.** B12. *g-7e15 (visual layer) + g-9c41 (sim layer) — two-sided
  boundary.* **OBSERVABLE:** sim-side and visual-side draw on ONE shared min-spec frame budget that is NOT
  double-spent; the sum is evaluated against a single frame envelope on the SAME profile crit-9 validates scale
  against (ties A1.7); there is a single named owner of the sim/visual boundary, accountable that the two shares
  fit one frame. acceptance: on the binding min-spec profile + worst-case scene, sim-side + visual-side time fit
  one envelope (no double-spend), scored against the same envelope crit-9 uses; exactly one accountable owner so
  a regression in one layer can't silently consume the other's share. `→PLAN`: the frame-budget number + the sim/
  visual split (A1.3 gas-ms, A5.3 render-ms); A8.3 coarse-tier tick ms + K-species multiplier; binding profile/
  proxy method (A1.4); binding scene (A1.5); **the frame-rate/FPS target**. bounds: A1.7, A1.3, A5.3, A8.3, A1.5.
  build: parked-edge. **owner_fork (DEFAULT taken):** the boundary OWNER = g-9c41 (sim owns the envelope + names
  the boundary, visual layer is claimant) vs a neutral whole-frame owner above both nodes → DEFAULT = g-9c41 owns
  sim-side + names the boundary (natural; ties A1.7); the neutral-owner option is deferred to the A1.7/crit-1↔
  crit-9 closure. canon: shared-frame-budget-single-owner. *[fix: "60-class" (a 60-FPS rate) leaked into the
  observable — removed; the FPS target → PLAN.]*

### G. Completeness sweep — remaining edges (TREE-completeness, honestly classified)

- **CS1 — Breach → topology-change consumer (B30, external).** *destruction-consumer (a PARKED later node =
  full destructibility) ← g-9c41 TopologyCore + GasDomain.* SAME observable shape + canon as GG3 (a real
  controlled local breach = a geometry-only topology-change change-set adding vertical portal(s), deterministic
  id, gas flows after; ONE local breach mechanism day-one, no destruction SYSTEM). acceptance: same-breach →
  same-adjacency + same-revision on all peers (deterministic); gas across the new portal consistent host↔clients
  at settle (cites the LOCKED barrier + breach-affected cells in the hash domain); a breach opening no adjacency
  is a defect. `→PLAN`: breach-portal id encoding; deferred-commit timing; breachable surfaces + count; trigger
  wiring (explosion/damage threshold); revision-counter width; **the lockstep-broadcast delivery mechanism**.
  bounds: C12, C16, A2.1. build: **dangling:destruction-consumer** — the breach PRODUCER half is internal to
  g-9c41 day-one; the full-destructibility CONSUMER is a separate large unresolved edge PARKED to a later node
  (named, not dropped; producer exists first). canon: shared G:topology-change[breach] with GG3 (ONE line).
  *[fix: "lockstep-broadcast" moved to →PLAN — only the determinism property stays in the contract.]*
- **CS2 — Co-op roles capability (B7) — G7 acceptance row, NOT a data contract.** g-d3a8 (parked) asserts which
  asymmetric-role shapes the core must not preclude; g-9c41 confirms the host-authoritative + count-as-config
  model SUPPORTS them: any role expressible as a distinct per-client INPUT/COMMAND stream + a distinct per-client
  INTEREST/view is supported (all players are non-authoritative input sources against one host writer; no role is
  a second authoritative field writer); a role needing a second field authority is OUT, surfaced as an owner
  conflict. build: parked-edge G7 (a capability/acceptance fact a resolve pass signs; no cross-node data flows
  here). No canon (one node parked).
- **Honest non-contracts (named for tree-completeness, deliberately NOT manufactured into data contracts):**
  B15 (clip artifact form) = open→PLAN render/capture magnitude (A2.3/A5.5/A7.x). B16/B17/B19 (min solo-startable
  slice / distributable build / min-spec backs demo quality) = g-5b07 open→G7 acceptance rows that CONSUME
  existing real contracts (crit-7 clean-1-player A6.1/A6.2 + crit-1 min-spec) — they mint no new cross-node data
  shape. B18 (first-clip-as-Steam-milestone) = root map_order milestone/sequencing G7. B20/B21 (steady real-
  footage byproduct / agent-drivable capture) = g-e6f2 acceptance rows riding the already-real harness
  (crit-5/A4.x) + the real-footage-only policy (A7.3). B22 = ANSWERED (byproduct of crit 3/5). B23/B24/B25/B26
  (moat-real / core-fantasy split / reusable-tech-asset / pride) = root owner ACCEPTANCE verdicts (open→G7);
  B24/B25's arch-flavored half is already covered by the engine-free/portable R4 contract (#13 + crit-9).
  Manufacturing data contracts for these would itself be a firewall error (inventing observable shape where only
  a milestone/acceptance question exists).

## §SIGNOFF (converge-arch pass)

`§SIGNOFF: converge-arch DECLARE — SIGNED-in-part @ 2026-06-16 (c-converge-002).`

**§SIGNOFF-BH — band-handoff (GG4/OR4) — OWNER-SIGNED 2026-06-16 (voice, this session).** Echoed owner verdict:

важно» — OPEN to deeper tightening at the Wave-2 shape (so this signs the contract STRENGTH; the mechanism +
tolerance magnitude stay PLAN and the owner may revisit in-shape).

**Decided this leg (not open forks):**
- XL1 cross-layer consistency = (a) BOTH layers consistent together (done_when #10 "networked-consistent
  together" + ADR-0004 §T12 + RESOLVED-1); the cheaper gas-only reading rejected (weakens crit-10 + contradicts
  the LOCK).
- Parked-sibling forks declared with DEFAULTS, deferred to the sibling's OWN converge (NOT Wave-2 forks; owner
  may override there): GT5 agent-substrate = single field pathway (I12/R5); RN2 menace-motion = strict derivation
  (crit-6 default); RN4 frame-boundary owner = g-9c41 owns sim-side + names the boundary (A1.7).

**Still PENDING (resolve-pass G7 rows, not converge-arch contracts):** CS2 (co-op roles capability) + the
B15–B26 non-contracts are owner-owned acceptance/milestone rows a later resolve/shape pass signs.

## play_check (converge-arch pass)

- `declare: §CONTRACTS — every TREE g-9c41 interaction + internal seam → a contract or an honest non-contract
  classification (IN/GG/OR/XL/GT/RN/CS families); B1–B31 all mapped; consumer-driven observable; HOW→PLAN; no
  contract re-opens the LOCKED foundation (firewall-verified).` (done)
- `decompose (heavy): the 6 §3.9 components sketched; internal seams → internal contracts (GG1–GG4, XL1–XL2 in-
  core); GT1 (gas-domain species handler) vs XL2 (FieldFabric whole-layer registry) separated — they were
  conflated.` (done)
- `architect (heavy): the high-risk architecture-on-paper = brief v2 ARCH-1v2, imported born-closed, rides PLAN
  as input-evidence (recorded in work/converge-g-9c41-arch.md); the emergent contract-architecture high-risk
  questions (B31 cross-tier composition OR1; multi-layer consistency XL1; band-handoff GG4/OR4) authored
  observable-first with HOW→PLAN; one miner gap-hunt caught the cross-layer/extensibility white spot (XL1/XL2).`
  (done)
- `contract_coverage: every TREE interaction → a §CONTRACTS entry — YES (B1–B31 + internal grid↔gas + cross-
  layer seams; build-order named for every produced-now-consumed-later / dangling edge).` (done)
- `arch_open: 0 — the brief's picks are imported born-closed; emergent contract properties authored observable-
  first (a PLAN failure surfaces as a BLOCKED contract, not a silent green).` (done)
- `arch_in_context_only: PASS — no architecture pick leaked into done_when; architecture-on-paper rides PLAN
  context only.` (done)
- `owner decisions (G7): band-handoff SIGNED in-session (voice); cross-layer consistency decided on done_when
  #10 + LOCK; 3 parked-sibling forks declared with defaults + deferred; batched, not scattered.` (done)
- `canon_proposed: two-sided contract canon (read_by both nodes) proposed per promotable contract; review/pulse
  promote (NOT written to knowledge/).` (done)
- `hardening: 15-agent in-session pre-pass (wf_c4e09962-08f: 6 drafters → 6 adversarial firewalls → 3 cross-
  cutting critics); fixes folded (render-K1 formula-inline, render-K4 FPS leak, ingestion-K1 byte-identical,
  ingestion-K2 white-box, gas-K2 packing wording, gas-K6 I12-supersede, completeness-K1 lockstep-broadcast,
  self-play-lane reclassification, breach-canon dedupe); the cross-layer/extensibility WHITE SPOT (XL1/XL2)
  caught + added. This is an IN-SESSION pre-pass (same-session helpers), NOT the binding refutation.`
- `verify (the converge-verify PLAY): DEFERRED to a separate fresh session (boundary) — the next CALL.`
- `close & route: CHECKPOINT — next = converge-verify (independent refutation of the contract set) → then
  c-shape-wave2 consumes the VERIFIED contracts.`
