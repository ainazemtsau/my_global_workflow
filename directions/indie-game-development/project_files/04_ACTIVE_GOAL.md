## Active Goal snapshot

Active Goal is now `core-technical-foundation-decision-brief`.

The next valid route is `E1_EXECUTION_BRIEF` to prepare a staged execution decomposition for producing the accepted technical foundation decision brief / decision map.

## Deferred items

The active Goal must not silently decide or perform:

- Unity project creation;
- code transfer;
- final implementation;
- Task Master graph creation;
- Codex product/project execution;
- final multiplayer stack without evidence;
- final network authority model without decision record;
- exact gas taxonomy/reactions;
- final 25 cm vs 50 cm implementation;
- exact DI package / Unity folder layout / CI setup unless evidence is sufficient and the decision brief requires it;
- full engineering handbook;
- visual gas proof;
- Game Documentation promotion.

The active Goal may leave a surface unresolved only when the unresolved item is explicitly routed to `D1_DEEP_RESEARCH`, `A1_AUDIT`, `S3_DECIDE`, Context Request, or marked `deferred_not_blocking_for_bootstrap`.
