## Current phase meaning

`Core Co-op Technical Foundation Selection` exists to choose the high-lock-in technical foundation for a new co-op project before implementation.

## Почему это не повтор прошлой фазы

Previous closed Phase proved the Expedition proof identity and rejected gas-only proof. This Phase does not repeat proof identity work; it resolves technical foundation selection for a new project: multiplayer stack/architecture, Grid/Topology transfer, Gas Simulation architecture, and smallest durable nucleus.

## Next route

Run `R1_GOAL_REVIEW_DISTILL` for `first-technical-nucleus-functional-spec`.

Do not proceed until the repository evidence integrity repair is applied, read back, diff-verified, commit-verified, integrated to `main` or otherwise reported as unmerged, and refreshed in Project Files.

R1 must review the completed parent Goal outcome against the Goal Contract. It must not implement, run the Phase Progress Gate, launch P9, promote Game Documentation, or authorize product/project execution.

## 2026-05-16 R1 Phase Progress Gate

R1 accepted the current Goal as an accepted route-gated decision map.

Phase Progress Gate result: `continue_with_required_goal`.

P9 is not allowed now because Grid/Gas/GridV2/GasV2R transfer safety remains a required foundation audit surface before implementation.

Next route after R1 was `G1_GOAL_SHAPE` for `grid-gas-transfer-boundary-audit`; that route was later superseded by the 2026-05-16 G1 reset.

## 2026-05-16 G1 formalization

G1 shaped the required Grid/Gas/GridV2/GasV2R transfer-boundary audit Goal; this was later superseded after human clarification.

## 2026-05-16 G1 reset formalization

G1 superseded `grid-gas-transfer-boundary-audit` after human clarification and formalized `first-technical-nucleus-functional-spec` as the active Goal.

Historical next route at G1 reset: `E1_EXECUTION_BRIEF`.

Current next route after F0 synthesis formalization and evidence repair: `R1_GOAL_REVIEW_DISTILL`.
