## Current phase meaning

`Core Co-op Technical Foundation Selection` exists to choose the high-lock-in technical foundation for a new co-op project before implementation.

## Почему это не повтор прошлой фазы

Previous closed Phase proved the Expedition proof identity and rejected gas-only proof. This Phase does not repeat proof identity work; it resolves technical foundation selection for a new project: multiplayer stack/architecture, Grid/Topology transfer, Gas Simulation architecture, and smallest durable nucleus.

## Next route

Run `E1_EXECUTION_BRIEF` for `first-technical-nucleus-functional-spec`.

Do not proceed until this G1 repository patch is applied, read back, diff-verified, commit-verified, and refreshed in Project Files.

E1 must not implement. E1 must plan gated sequential execution and preserve the required user approval gate after the gas simulation capability frame.

## 2026-05-16 R1 Phase Progress Gate

R1 accepted the current Goal as an accepted route-gated decision map.

Phase Progress Gate result: `continue_with_required_goal`.

P9 is not allowed now because Grid/Gas/GridV2/GasV2R transfer safety remains a required foundation audit surface before implementation.

Next route after R1 was `G1_GOAL_SHAPE` for `grid-gas-transfer-boundary-audit`; that route was later superseded by the 2026-05-16 G1 reset.

## 2026-05-16 G1 formalization

G1 shaped the required Grid/Gas/GridV2/GasV2R transfer-boundary audit Goal; this was later superseded after human clarification.

## 2026-05-16 G1 reset formalization

G1 superseded `grid-gas-transfer-boundary-audit` after human clarification and formalized `first-technical-nucleus-functional-spec` as the active Goal.

Next route: `E1_EXECUTION_BRIEF`.
